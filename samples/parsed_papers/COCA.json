    "abstract": "The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated remarkable success in engaging in conversations involving visual inputs, thanks to the superior power of large language models (LLMs). Those MLLMs are typically built based on the LLMs, with an image encoder to process images into the token embedding space of the LLMs. However, the integration of visual modality has introduced a unique vulnerability: the MLLM becomes susceptible to malicious visual inputs and prone to generating sensitive or harmful responses, even though the LLM has been trained on textual dataset to align with human value. In this paper, we first raise the following question: \"Do the MLLMs possess safety-awareness against malicious image inputs?\". We find that after adding a principle that specifies the safety requirement into the input of the MLLM, the model's safety awareness becomes boosted. This phenomenon verifies the existence of MLLM's safety-awareness against image inputs, it is only weakened by the modality gap. We then introduce a simple yet effective technique termed Constitutional Calibration (CoCA), which amplifies the safety-awareness of the MLLM by calibrating its output distribution. Our proposed strategy helps the model reclaim its original safety awareness without losing its original capabilities. We verify the effectiveness of our approach on both multimodal safety and understanding benchmarks. Recent research has made the following discovery: MLLMs are prone to generating harmful responses given input images related to malicious intents (",

            "heading": "Introduction",
            "text": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a significant breakthrough in the field of generative AI, fundamentally revolutionizing natural language processing and comprehension (Geng & Liu, 2023;OpenAI, 2023;Touvron et al., 2023;Scao et al., 2022;Chowdhery et al., 2022;Taori et al., 2023;Chiang et al., 2023;Pi et al., 2024d). These models, which undergo extensive training on large-scale corpus datasets, excel at generating coherent and contextually appropriate text, possess great reasoning ability, and contain rich world knowledge. These properties make them valuable tools for various downstream applications. Furthermore, with the progresses made in LLMs, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that are based on LLMs have also witnessed significant achievements (Liu et al., 2023a;Zhu et al., 2023;Su et al., 2023;Dai et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023b;OpenAI, 2023;Bai et al., 2023), which incorporate visual modalities into the LLMs to engage in conversations incorporating visual inputs. These models inherits the appealing properties such as the world knowledge and reasoning abilities from LLMs, thereby unlocking a multitude of potential applications, such as autonomous driving (Ding et al., 2023) and medical assistant (Li et al., 2023a).\nLLMs that they are based on have achieved good safety performances through techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For instance, if an image of a bomb is provided to the MLLM with a textual query \"how to make this item?\", the MLLM can be easily tricked to generate a detailed guide for creating a bomb. This phenomenon could be intuitively explained as follows: after the multimodal training, the MLLMs become capable of interpreting image inputs. However, there is still a modality gap between the continuous image representations and the discrete textual tokens, which makes the MLLMs susceptible to malicious image inputs.\nGiven the aforementioned vulnerability suffered by the MLLMs, we make the first exploration towards an important question: \"Do the MLLMs retain their safety-awareness against malicious image inputs?\" In response to this, we experiment with a straightforward solution: appending an additional guideline explicitly stating the safety requirement to the input of the MLLM, such as \"The assistant cannot provide answers related to illegal activities\". With this simple approach, we observe enhancement in the model's safety awareness and heightened vigilance towards malicious image inputs. This observation suggests that the safety awareness inherited from safety training with textual data is transferable to image inputs, it is only weakened due to the modality gap, which can be partially regained via adding prompts regarding safety. Therefore, a natural question is: \"Can we amplify the impact of the safety prompt to further strengthen the MLLM's awareness?\"\nBuilding upon the initial observation, we explore a simple yet effective technique termed Constitutional Calibration (CoCA) for MLLM, which amplifies the impact of the safety prompt and calibrates the output distribution of the MLLM, thereby allowing the model to regain its original safety awareness. Specifically, during MLLM inference, prior to generating each token, we calculate the disparity between the logits of tokens with and without the supplementary safety prompt. Subsequently, we multiply this disparity by a scaling factor and incorporate it into the original logit. This scaling factor serves as an explicit control mechanism for the strength of the safety prompt. Surprisingly, we discover that this logit calibration not only enhances safety awareness but also preserves the MLLM's visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.\nIn summary, the contribution of our work are threefold:\n• We verify that the MLLMs indeed possess safety-awareness against malicious image inputs, which is weakened due to the modality gap;\n• We explore a simple yet effective approach termed Constitutional Calibration (CoCA) for MLLM, which effectively amplifies the impact of the safety prompt and calibrates the output distribution of the MLLM in a training-free manner, thereby allowing the model to regain its safety awareness inherited from textual safety training;\n• We conduct thorough extensive experiments to verify that our approach not only enhances safety awareness, but also preserves the MLLM's original visual understanding and visual reasoning capabilities.

We amplify this discrepancy and add it to the predicted token probability during the decoding phase. The adjusted logit values are then processed through a softmax function to calculate the final probability distribution.\nmodel (LLM), the construction of a reliable multimodal safety dataset for fine-tuning the safety of a multimodal language model (MLLM) poses a significant challenge. Recent research indicates that utilizing existing datasets containing malicious user queries and stable-diffusion-generated images for SFT training of MLLMs results in only marginal enhancements in safety and sometimes inadvertently increases the likelihood of successful attacks (Pi et al., 2024a;Gou et al., 2024). Additionally, directly applying SFT for safety on MLLMs can compromise their general capabilities (Gou et al., 2024).\nThe difficulty of conducting safety alignment on MLLMs mainly lies in the following two aspects:\n• Firstly, the continuous nature of images, in contrast to the discrete nature of text, presents a significant hurdle for alignment tuning. It is more complex to cover a comprehensive range of input images that encompass all potential scenarios. • Secondly, MLLMs are typically less robust than text-based LLMs, since the image modality is not incorporated until the fine-tuning stage. Therefore, significantly less training data and shorter training durations are used for the image modality compared to the extensive text-based pre-training processes. The conventional methods of alignment, such as SFT or RLHF, can lead to catastrophic forgetting and high alignment taxes (Sun et al., 2023), compromising the model's effectiveness in performing visual tasks (Lin et al., 2024;Zhu et al., 2024).\nGiven these challenges, we believe inference-time alignment is a direct and supplementary strategy to training-based alignment for MLLM safety.",

However, our experiments revealed an intriguing possibility: by incorporating safety principles directly into the instructions, e.g., \"The assistant cannot provide answers related to illegal activities\", we observed a noticeable improvement in the MLLM's safety awareness. This outcome indicates that the safety-awareness inherited from the textual safety training is indeed adaptable to image inputs.\nThis observation led us to consider whether the inherited safety-awareness could be further strengthened. Implementing more detailed safety guidelines in the system prompts is one straightforward strategy. However, we experimentally find that too detailed instructions does not result in considerable improvement ( Table 4). We assume the reason lies in the LLMs' inherent limitations in following complex instructions accurately.\nWe then pose the following question: \"Can we implicitly amplify the impact of the safety guideline without making the prompt more complex?\" Inspired by recent progress on contrastive decoding on LLM (Li et al., 2023c;Liu et al., 2024a;Sennrich et al., 2024), we design an approach to derive the instance-wise safety preference \"delta\" of MLLM with different prompts. Then, we utilize the obtained \"delta\" during the decoding phase to amplify the safety of MLLM. This approach aims to subtly improve the model's adherence to safety instructions in a train-free manner, thereby mitigating the safety concerns in MLLMs without hurting the model's original capabilities.",

The adjusted logit values are then processed through a softmax function, denoted as σ(•), to calculate the ultimate probability distribution.\nThe safety principle in a model's instructions enhances its capacity to generate outputs that are safer and more aligned with ethical guidelines. The absence of this principle leads to outputs with a higher propensity for harmful content. The difference in logits between responses generated with and without the safety principle serves as a measure of the model's inclination towards safe content generation. By calculating this safety delta given instance-wise visual inputs, we can amplify the safety awareness during the inference stage by adjusting the token generation probabilities, effectively enhancing the safety of the content produced.\nWhen the queries are related to safety issues, we expect to observe significant differences in outputs with and without the safety principle.

            "text": "Multi-Modal Large Language Model. In recent years, the field of large language models (LLMs) has experienced significant advancements, as evidenced by several representative works (Brown et al., 2020;Scao et al., 2022;Chowdhery et al., 2022;Smith et al., 2022;Hoffmann et al., 2022;Ouyang et al., 2022;Touvron et al., 2023;Bai et al., 2022a;Ye et al., 2022b). These breakthroughs have greatly enhanced language understanding and generation capabilities, demonstrating remarkable proficiency across a wide range of tasks. Moreover, the success of LLMs has sparked interest in exploring the intersection of vision and language, giving rise to the development of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) (Liu et al., 2023a;Li et al., 2023b;Dai et al., 2023;Zhu et al., 2023;Gao et al., 2023c;Dai et al., 2023;Pi et al., 2023;OpenAI, 2023;Bai et al., 2023;Pi et al., 2024c;Gao et al., 2023b). These models are built upon the powerful LLMs, which inherit the superior reasoning ability and rich world knowledge. Therefore, the MLLMs exhibit impressive capabilities in engaging in dialogue based on visual inputs. However, it has been observed that current state-of-theart MLLMs are increasingly susceptible malicious visual inputs and prone to generating harmful responses.\nMLLMs Safety. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the jailbreak of Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs). For instance, a benchmark has been proposed to evaluate the robustness of MLLMs against malicious image inputs, including stable-diffusion generated images and images with malicious query (Liu et al., 2023c). MLLM-protector (Pi et al., 2024a) leverages an external response classifier and corrector to enhance MLLM protection. Additionally, image-to-text translation has been proposed as a means to ensure safe generation of text from images (Gou et al., 2024). Although these methods demonstrate improved robustness against malicious image queries, they either depend on the performance of external components or require generating a detailed textual caption before responding to each query. On the contrary, our paper is the first to demonstrate the presence of inherent safety awareness in MLLMs when confronted with malicious images, and the safety awareness can be enhanced in a training-free manner.  (2024) present evidence that contrasting inputs on the same model can mitigate issues such as hallucination and off-target problems in translation. Mitchell et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2024a) have recently utilized the difference in logits from the small LM to guide the decoding of a large LM. Gao et al. (2024); Zhao et al. (2024) provide evidence that calibration during inference-time decoding is effective for aligning LLM. In contrast to prior research conducted on LLM, our study represents the pioneering effort in examining the efficacy of contrastive decoding on MLLM safety. We amplify the model's safety awareness by leveraging its ability, rather than introducing an external language model.",

We first make the observation that despite the integration of visual modality makes the MLLMs more vulnerable, the inherent safetyawareness of MLLMs still exists. To mitigate this issue, we propose a technique called Constitutional Calibration (CoCA), which amplifies the safety-awareness of MLLMs in a training-free manner, while preserving their original performance. We hope this research provides more insights to the safety-awareness of MLLMs, which further contributes to the development of safer and more reliable MLLMs.\nGeneral Task-Specific Detailed Illustration Content Principle 1 (P1) ✓ The assistant's answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content.\nPrinciple 2 -Illegal Activity (P2-IA) ✓ ✓\nThe assistant should answer in a harmless, ethical and inoffensive manner.

            "text": "Attack and Defense. Attacks targeting large language models (LLMs) can be classified into two main categories: malicious utilization by users (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022;Liu et al., 2023d;Xie et al., 2023;2024a;Han et al., 2024) and attacks by third parties targeting regular users (Yi et al., 2023;Greshake et al., 2023). Malicious utilization by users encompasses various techniques, such as jailbreak attacks (Kang et al., 2023;Xie et al., 2023;Shayegani et al., 2023;Xie et al., 2024b), prompt leakage attacks (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022), and prompt injection attacks (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022;Liu et al., 2023d). These attacks aim to exploit the models by providing intentionally crafted inputs that generate outputs deviating from ethical alignment. These outputs can be harmful, misleading, or compromise privacy. In response to these attacks, defense mechanisms have been proposed, particularly for LLMs. These defense strategies include self-reminders (Xie et al., 2023), input detection (Robey et al., 2023), and in-context learning (Wei et al., 2023). Their objective is to mitigate the impact of malicious user utilization. On the other hand, attacks by third parties targeting regular users represent another category, exemplified by indirect prompt injection attacks (Yi et al., 2023;Greshake et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2023d). In these attacks, a third party inserts prompts into external content, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a user's query, thereby affecting the user experience. To safeguard against such attacks, strategies have been proposed to help LLMs differentiate between a genuine user query and external content (Yi et al., 2023).\nModel Alignment. The concept of alignment, originally introduced in Leike et al. (2018), aims to ensure that an agent's actions align with human intentions. This concept was first implemented in large language models by InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), Claude (Bai et al., 2022b), and Sparrow (Glaese et al., 2022). These models utilize scalable reward learning techniques (Leike et al., 2018;Christiano et al., 2018;Irving et al., 2018) derived from supervised signals based on communication (Ziegler et al., 2019).

We have also conducted human verification and find GPT-4 evaluation is almost accurate.\nThe results indicate that after performing multi-modal SFT safety alignment, there was no notable reduction in ASR. However, with our inference-time calibration method, CoCA, the ASR decreased markedly across all sub-tasks. The significantly lower gpt4-evaluated ASR in the bottom part demonstrates CoCA's effectiveness. This could be attributed to the challenges in constructing training corpora that comprehensively encompasses malicious visual content, and the MLLM's vulnerability due to insufficient multimodality training. On the other hand, our CoCA awakens the safety awareness directly during inference. In addition, our method may serve as a complement to traditional SFT alignment methods. ",
